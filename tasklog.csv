02/14/17,Worklog,10,"Made some slight changes to ""Worklog.py"". There was a pretty serious glitch with the dates (Not sure how the tester passed my project without catching this). Fixed it, so now a list of unique dates displays correctly, and can be selected for viewing. Decided to use this on a daily basis to record my actions. That way, anyone taking over can see what I do on a day-to-day basis; this is for accountability and transparency, as well as a backup ""SOP"" for my position, should I leave. If you are reading this, good luck."

02/14/17,Employee List For Culture,25,"Fixing the Employee List made for culture. Amanda and Diana said it doesn't work on their macs -- tested it, and it runs fine. Updated  one of the formulas which was treating an empty termination date as a zero instead of an empty string. Everything has been verified and is perfect. The list records were current before the mass layoffs, so they are wrong now. Culture should have the most up-to-date information."
02/14/17,Accounts Receivable,5,"Argued with Cade Liston about ScoPros -- He kept insisting that ScoPros are prepaid, and I kept insisting that the given name on the sales order had no payments in QuickBooks.

02/17/17,Worklog,20,"(09:30AM - 09:50AM) Updated the worklog to include updated list options for searching by date -- To add the year and month would be a cool test of my skills, but a huge time-suck on a project that's going to be useless in a month. After setting up most of the pieces for it, I deleted them all -- I'm going to instead clone the repository and turn it into the peewee one."
02/17/17,Collections,25,(10:04AM - 10:29AM) Tried to do collections but only Autem Novus was prepaid -- everyone else I couldn't find any payment info for.
